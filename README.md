#JoelHelperBot

This bot was created to create, improve, and maintain English Wikipedia's [US Presidential Election imagemaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:United_States_presidential_election_imagemaps), which are all very similar, and tedious to do by hand. As of its creation, the maps are only clickable going back to 1876, and the clickable areas are notably misaligned from the states they represent.

In the future, it may be used for other similar activities that involve editing large numbers of pages that are duplicative and largely generated, as such pages that need editing come to my attention.

In its present form, this bot is not so much a coherent bot as much as a collection of scripts (well, currently one script) that use the bot's account to do batch edits.

Each function will be given its own folder - currently, just the ElectionMaps one.
